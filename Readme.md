## How to Use

Open preference panel, and click a button named “Open Theme Folder” under section “Appearance”, would open Typora’s theme folder in Finder/Explorer.

You would add your custom theme here. If you want to find, install or write themes see the [About Themes page](https://support.typora.io/About-Themes)

But sometimes, you may only want to modify CSS like changing font or increase writing area, and apply it to all themes or current theme without writing a whole new theme file, this document will show you how-to.
